1.How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Ans:We had an earlier version of project that was working fine,when we found the differences it became
very easy to figure out bug as we have to look only differeces.

2.How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Ans:Having entire history of file we can easily get clear idea about what changes are made during the time.
We can compare different versions and it helps in reading code effectively.

3.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Ans:Pros are that we get flexibility,readability and cons can be sometimes messing up.

4.Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others,
 like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Ans:Programming involves changing different files frequently so it is better to save multiple fles each time you commit.

5.How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Ans:git log can be used to see all the commits and git diff can be used to find the differences between the commits.

6.How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Ans:We can return to the previous commits so that will not cause any harm to us.

7.Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Ans:For comitting my android projects so that i can make unexpected changes to my code.
