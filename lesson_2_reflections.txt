1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Ans:when we initialize repo then a hidden file .git gets added (can be viewed by ls -a).
So that we can commit our versions in it.

2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Ans:Staging area is just a place where commits are being stored temporarily before makig commit.
It offers us to add files which we want to commit rather than putting all files in git repo.

3.How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Ans:By using the command git diff --staged we can look for the changes.
